(READ ONLY) What Is Prism Pro
-------------------------------

Overview
++++++++

Prism Pro is a product designed to make our customer IT operations smart and automated. Today, there is no solution that is specifically designed for data center IT operations built around HCI. The infrastructure in this type of data center is dynamic, scalable, and highly performed. Traditional performance monitoring and IT OPS tools are built for static infrastructure. When IT admins use the traditional tools to manage HCI environments, they are overwhelmed by the complexity and noisy signals the tool brings. This decreases the productivity of the operations and reduces the ROI from adopting HCI.

Prism Pro takes a unique approach that maximizes the operation efficiency of an HCI based data center. First, Prism Pro uses purpose-built machine learning (X-FIT) to extract the insights from the mass amount of operations data the HCI produces. The first three use cases Prism Pro shipped are capacity forecast and planning, VM right sizing, and anomaly detection. These use cases help our customers detect problems and waste with the actionable signal. Second, Prism Pro delivers an automation mechanism (X-Play) that enables customers to automate their operations tasks confidently to respond to the signal X-FIT detects.

X-Play is designed to address the number 1 pain point when customers deal with automation - the fear of amplified impact because of the complexity of the automation. Not like the solution, such as Calm, for the application lifecycle automation, X-Playâ€™s goal is to automate the simple tasks that admins face daily. To eliminate the fear and give the control back to the admin, X-Play takes the codeless approach which has been proven in the companies such as IFTTT and Zapier that it is easy to adopt and extremely versatile.

There are no other tools in the market taking this approach and has the power to combine intelligence and codeless automation. The power of X-FIT and X-Play allows the customer to truly leverage the machine data the HCI infrastructure produces and operate it efficiently, confidently, and intelligently.
